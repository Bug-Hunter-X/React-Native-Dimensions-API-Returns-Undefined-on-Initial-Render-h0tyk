This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development involving the `Dimensions` API. The `Dimensions` API sometimes returns `undefined` or `null` during the initial component render, leading to layout problems.  The example shows how this can occur and provides a solution using the `useEffect` hook to ensure that the dimensions are available before rendering.  The solution effectively handles the asynchronous nature of getting screen dimensions, preventing the undefined values from causing errors.
